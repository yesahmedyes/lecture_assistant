Create a research plan (120-150 words) that includes:

1. Learning Objectives (2-3 specific, measurable goals):
   - What should students understand by the end?
   - What skills or knowledge will they gain?
   - Focus on actionable outcomes

2. Core Content Sections (3-5 main areas to cover):
   - Organize by logical flow (introduction → fundamentals → advanced → applications)
   - Each section should build on the previous one
   - Include both theoretical and practical aspects where relevant

3. Research Priorities & Constraints:
   - Which aspects need the most authoritative sources?
   - Are there specific perspectives, time periods, or contexts to emphasize?
   - Any limitations or boundaries to consider (e.g., avoiding outdated information, focusing on specific applications)

Format your response clearly with labeled sections. Be specific and strategic—this plan will guide the entire research and content creation process.
