CRITICAL: The slides MUST be based directly on the content in the brief above. Extract key information from the brief sections (Lecture Summary, Key Concepts, Teaching Plan, etc.) and transform them into presentation slides. Do not invent new content or deviate from what is in the brief.

Create a minimalistic presentation slide deck (approximately 15 slides) in Markdown format. Each slide should be separated by `---` (three dashes on a new line).

Required sections based on the brief:

1. TITLE SLIDE
   - Slide title (the topic from the brief)
   - Optional: Subtitle based on brief context

2. INTRODUCTION (2-3 slides)
   - Extract content from the "LECTURE SUMMARY" section of the brief
   - Context and background from the brief
   - Why this topic matters (from the brief)
   - Objectives or goals (if mentioned in the brief)

3. KEY CONCEPTS (4-6 slides)
   - Extract ALL key concepts from the "KEY CONCEPTS" section of the brief
   - Each concept should be on its own slide or grouped logically
   - Include the definitions/explanations from the brief
   - Preserve citation numbers [n] from the brief where they appear
   - Keep bullets concise (1-2 lines each)

4. MAIN CONTENT (3-5 slides)
   - Extract the ACTUAL CONTENT POINTS from the "TEACHING PLAN WITH TIMING" section
   - Do NOT create slides about the teaching plan structure or timing
   - Instead, take the key points, topics, and concepts mentioned in each segment and turn them into content slides
   - Each slide should present the actual information/points to be taught, not meta-information about how to teach it
   - Include citations [n] where they appear in the brief
   - Example: If the teaching plan says "Cover: Machine learning basics, supervised vs unsupervised learning", create slides about "Machine Learning Basics" and "Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning" - don't create a slide saying "Teaching Plan: Cover machine learning basics"

5. SUMMARY (1 slide)
   - High-level overview based on the brief's summary
   - Key takeaways from the brief

6. FURTHER READING (1 slide)
   - Extract from the "CITATIONS REFERENCE" section of the brief
   - Format as: [n] Source Title - URL
   - Include 5-8 most relevant citations from the brief

Format each slide as:

# Slide Title

Content here...

---

# Next Slide Title

More content...

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Extract content directly from the brief - do not add new information not in the brief
- Preserve all citation numbers [n] exactly as they appear in the brief
- Keep slides minimalistic: 3-5 bullet points max per slide
- Use clear, concise language from the brief
- Maintain the logical flow and structure of the brief
- If the brief mentions specific examples, concepts, or points, include them in the slides
- Do not invent "risks" or "findings" if they are not in the brief

Output the complete slide deck in Markdown format with `---` separators between slides.
