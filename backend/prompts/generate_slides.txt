Create a minimalistic presentation slide deck (approximately 15 slides) in Markdown format. Each slide should be separated by `---` (three dashes on a new line).

Required sections:

1. TITLE SLIDE
   - Slide title (the topic)
   - Optional: Subtitle or date

2. INTRODUCTION (2-3 slides)
   - Context and background
   - Why this topic matters
   - Objectives or goals

3. SUMMARY (1-2 slides)
   - High-level overview
   - Key takeaways

4. KEY FINDINGS (4-6 slides)
   - 3-6 bullet points with citations
   - Each finding should be on its own slide or grouped logically
   - Include citation numbers in format [n] where n corresponds to sources
   - Keep bullets concise (1-2 lines each)

5. RISKS (1-2 slides)
   - 3 risk items
   - Each risk should be clear and actionable
   - Can be on one slide or split across slides

6. FURTHER READING (1 slide)
   - 5-8 items
   - Format as: Title - URL or Author, Title (Year)
   - Use the prioritized sources provided

Format each slide as:

# Slide Title

Content here...

---

# Next Slide Title

More content...

Keep slides minimalistic:
- Use clear, concise language
- Limit text per slide (3-5 bullet points max)
- Use simple formatting (headers, bullets, bold for emphasis)
- Avoid dense paragraphs
- Ensure readability at presentation distance

Output the complete slide deck in Markdown format with `---` separators between slides.
