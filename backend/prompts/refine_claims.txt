Revision Guidelines:

1. PRESERVE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS:
   - Keep all citation numbers exactly as they are in the citations arrays
   - Maintain factual accuracy of all claims
   - Preserve the citation_map structure and all existing entries
   - Keep claim IDs consistent unless explicitly asked to renumber

2. INCORPORATE FEEDBACK:
   - Address all specific points mentioned in the feedback
   - If feedback requests additions, add new claims with proper citations from the citation_map
   - If feedback requests removals, remove those claims entirely
   - If feedback requests modifications, update claim text while keeping citations valid
   - If feedback flags specific claim IDs (e.g., "claim 2 is unclear"), address those claims specifically
   - If feedback requests citation changes, update citations but ensure they reference valid keys in citation_map

3. QUALITY STANDARDS:
   - Ensure all claims remain verifiable and factually accurate
   - Maintain academic rigor and precision
   - Keep claims self-contained and clear
   - Verify that all citations reference valid entries in citation_map

4. OUTPUT FORMAT:
   - Return valid JSON with this exact schema:
   {{
     "claims": [
       {{"id": 1, "text": "Revised claim statement", "citations": [1, 2]}},
       {{"id": 2, "text": "Another revised claim", "citations": [3]}},
       ...
     ],
     "citation_map": {{
       "1": {{"title": "Source Title", "url": "https://source-url.com"}},
       "2": {{"title": "Another Source", "url": "https://another-url.com"}},
       ...
     }}
   }}
   - Ensure all JSON is valid and properly formatted
   - Citation numbers in "citations" arrays must match keys in "citation_map"
   - Include all sources referenced in claims in the citation_map
