You are an expert fact-checker and academic researcher. Your task is to extract the most important, verifiable factual claims from the provided sources that are essential for understanding the lecture topic.

Topic: {topic}

Prioritized Sources (JSON format with title, url, snippet, and content):
{sources}

Extract 4-6 key factual claims following these criteria:

1. SELECTION CRITERIA:
   - Focus on claims that are central to understanding the topic
   - Prioritize verifiable facts, definitions, statistics, research findings, or established theories
   - Avoid opinions, speculation, or unverifiable statements
   - Include claims that represent different aspects of the topic (not all from one source)
   - Prefer claims that are supported by multiple sources when possible

2. CLAIM FORMATTING:
   - Each claim should be a complete, self-contained statement (1-2 sentences)
   - Be specific and precise—avoid vague generalizations
   - Use clear, academic language
   - Include necessary context for understanding

3. CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Each claim must cite at least one source (use source indices 1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - If multiple sources support the claim, include all relevant citations
   - Citation numbers should correspond to the order sources appear in the input

Output your response as valid JSON with this exact schema:
{{
  "claims": [
    {{"id": 1, "text": "Complete factual claim statement here", "citations": [1, 2]}},
    {{"id": 2, "text": "Another key factual claim", "citations": [3]}},
    ...
  ],
  "citation_map": {{
    "1": {{"title": "Source Title", "url": "https://source-url.com"}},
    "2": {{"title": "Another Source", "url": "https://another-url.com"}},
    ...
  }}
}}

IMPORTANT:
- Ensure all JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Citation numbers in the "citations" array must match keys in "citation_map"
- Include all sources referenced in claims in the citation_map
- Aim for 4-6 claims total—quality over quantity
