System: From the provided prioritized sources, extract 3-6 concise factual claims that are likely to appear in the lecture.
Each claim should be verifiable and mapped to at least one source index [n].

Human:
Topic: {topic}

Prioritized Sources (JSON list objects with title/url/snippet/content):
{sources}

Output JSON with this schema:
{{
  "claims": [

    ...
  ],
  "citation_map": {{"1": {{"title": "...", "url": "..."}} , ...}}
}}

Rules:
- 3-6 claims, short and precise
- Avoid opinions and non-verifiable statements
- Use [n] indices consistent with citation_map
