1. PRESERVE CRITICAL ELEMENTS:
   - Keep ALL citation numbers [1], [2], etc. exactly as they appear
   - Maintain the complete structure (sections, subsections, hierarchy)
   - Preserve all factual content, definitions, and data
   - Keep learning objectives unless preferences explicitly change them

2. ADJUST TONE AND EMPHASIS:
   - Modify wording to match the requested tone (e.g., more accessible, more technical, more practical, more theoretical)
   - Adjust emphasis on different aspects based on preferences
   - Change introductory or explanatory language to align with the desired style
   - Modify section descriptions and transitions to reflect the new focus

3. INTERPRET PREFERENCES:
   - If preferences mention "more practical": emphasize applications, examples, real-world use cases
   - If preferences mention "more theoretical": emphasize concepts, frameworks, abstract principles
   - If preferences mention "simpler language": use more accessible terms, add explanations
   - If preferences mention "more technical": use precise terminology, assume more background knowledge
   - If preferences mention specific topics to emphasize: expand those areas, add more detail
   - If preferences mention topics to de-emphasize: reduce detail but keep essential information
