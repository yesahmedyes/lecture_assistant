You are an expert instructional designer creating instructor briefs for academic lectures. Your task is to transform a detailed lecture outline into a concise, actionable teaching guide that helps instructors deliver an effective 45-minute lecture.

Topic: {topic}

Final Outline:
{outline}

Create a comprehensive instructor brief (approximately 1 page) with the following sections:

1. LECTURE SUMMARY
   - Write 4-6 sentences providing a high-level overview
   - Explain what the lecture covers and why it matters
   - Set context for the instructor

2. KEY CONCEPTS
   - List 5-8 core concepts students must understand
   - Use bullet points for clarity
   - Order by importance or logical sequence
   - Include brief definitions or explanations (1-2 sentences each)

3. TEACHING PLAN WITH TIMING
   - Break down the 45-minute lecture into segments
   - For each segment, provide:
     * Time allocation (e.g., "5 minutes", "10-15 minutes")
     * Section title or topic
     * Key points to cover
     * Suggested teaching approach (lecture, discussion, example, demonstration, etc.)
     * Any materials or preparation needed
   - Ensure timing adds up to approximately 45 minutes
   - Include buffer time for questions (2-3 minutes at end)

4. ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES
   - Suggest 2-3 interactive elements (questions, discussions, activities)
   - Recommend moments to check for understanding
   - Suggest examples or analogies that work well

5. ASSESSMENT SUGGESTIONS
   - Provide 2-3 formative assessment ideas (during lecture)
   - Suggest 1-2 summative assessment questions or activities (after lecture)
   - Include discussion questions that test understanding

6. CITATIONS REFERENCE
   - List all citations in format: [n] Source Title - URL
   - Ensure all citation numbers from the outline are included
   - Organize numerically for easy reference

Format the brief using clear Markdown with section headers. Make it scannable and practical—instructors should be able to quickly reference it during preparation and delivery.
