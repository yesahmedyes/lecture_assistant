Your task is to transform a lecture brief into a concise slide deck suitable for presentation.\n\nUser:\nTopic: {topic}\n\nBrief:\n{brief}\n\nPrioritized Sources:\n{sources}\n\nExtracted Claims:\n{claims}\n\nCreate a minimalistic presentation slide deck (approximately 15 slides) in Markdown format. Each slide should be separated by `---` (three dashes on a new line).\n\nRequired sections:\n\n1. TITLE SLIDE\n   - Slide title (the topic)\n   - Optional: Subtitle or date\n\n2. INTRODUCTION (2-3 slides)\n   - Context and background\n   - Why this topic matters\n   - Objectives or goals\n\n3. SUMMARY (1-2 slides)\n   - High-level overview\n   - Key takeaways\n\n4. KEY FINDINGS (4-6 slides)\n   - 3-6 bullet points with citations\n   - Each finding should be on its own slide or grouped logically\n   - Include citation numbers in format [n] where n corresponds to sources\n   - Keep bullets concise (1-2 lines each)\n\n5. RISKS (1-2 slides)\n   - 3 risk items\n   - Each risk should be clear and actionable\n   - Can be on one slide or split across slides\n\n6. FURTHER READING (1 slide)\n   - 5-8 items\n   - Format as: Title - URL or Author, Title (Year)\n   - Use the prioritized sources provided\n\nFormat each slide as:\n\n# Slide Title\n\nContent here...\n\n---\n\n# Next Slide Title\n\nMore content...\n\nKeep slides minimalistic:\n- Use clear, concise language\n- Limit text per slide (3-5 bullet points max)\n- Use simple formatting (headers, bullets, bold for emphasis)\n- Avoid dense paragraphs\n- Ensure readability at presentation distance\n\nOutput the complete slide deck in Markdown format with `---` separators between slides.\n\n", "outputs": {"slides_len": 3981, "slides_preview": "```markdown\n# Machine Learning\n\nAn Introduction to Key Concepts and Applications  \nDate: [Insert Date]\n\n---\n\n# Introduction: Context and Background\n\n- Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI).\n- It enables systems to learn from data and improve performance over time.\n- Essential for various industries, including healthcare and finance.\n\n---\n\n# Introduction: Why This Topic Matters\n\n- ML is transforming how we analyze data and make decisions.\n- Understanding ML is crucial in today's data-driven world.\n- It has significant implications for innovation and efficiency.\n\n---\n\n# Introduction: Objectives\n\n- Introduce foundational concepts of machine learning.\n- Explore types of learning and algorithms.\n- Discuss real-world applications and ethical considerations.\n\n---\n\n# Summary: High-Level Overview\n\n- Machine learning allows systems to learn from data without explicit programming.\n- Key types include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.\n- Ethical considerations are vital in ML applications.\n\n---\n\n# Summary: Key Takeaways\n\n- ML is integral to AI and has diverse applications.\n- Understanding data preprocessing and model evaluation is crucial.\n- Ethic"}, "model": {"model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.2, "seed": 42}}
