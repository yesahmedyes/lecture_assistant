INTERPRET PREFERENCES:\n   - If preferences mention \"more practical\": emphasize applications, examples, real-world use cases\n   - If preferences mention \"more theoretical\": emphasize concepts, frameworks, abstract principles\n   - If preferences mention \"simpler language\": use more accessible terms, add explanations\n   - If preferences mention \"more technical\": use precise terminology, assume more background knowledge\n   - If preferences mention specific topics to emphasize: expand those areas, add more detail\n   - If preferences mention topics to de-emphasize: reduce detail but keep essential information\n\n4. MAINTAIN QUALITY:\n   - Ensure the outline remains comprehensive and lecture-ready\n   - Keep transitions smooth and logical\n   - Maintain academic accuracy\n   - Verify all citations still align with their referenced content\n\n5. OUTPUT FORMAT:\n   - Return the complete revised outline in the same Markdown format\n   - Include title, learning objectives, full structure, and citation mapping\n   - Ensure formatting is clean and consistent\n\nRevise the outline now, adjusting tone and focus while preserving all structure and citations:\n\n\n", "outputs": {"revised_len": 8441, "revised_preview": "# Lecture Outline: Understanding Computer Vision\n\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this lecture, participants will be able to:\n1. **Define** the basic ideas behind computer vision and why it matters in today’s tech landscape.\n2. **Analyze** the main techniques used in computer vision, like image recognition, object detection, and segmentation.\n3. **Evaluate** how computer vision is applied in different industries, showcasing its role in driving innovation and improving efficiency.\n4. **Apply** knowledge of machine learning, deep learning techniques, and programming to tackle real-world computer vision challenges.\n5. **Discuss** the hurdles and future possibilities in computer vision research and its applications.\n\n## LECTURE OUTLINE STRUCTURE\n\n### 1. Introduction to Computer Vision\n- **Context and Motivation**\n  - Let’s kick things off by defining computer vision. It’s a cool branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps machines understand and interpret visual data [1][2]. \n  - Why should we care? Computer vision is behind some amazing applications, from self-driving cars to medical imaging and augmented reality [3][4].\n  - A quick history lesson: we’ll look at how compute"}, "model": {"model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.2, "seed": 42}}
